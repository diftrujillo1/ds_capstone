## How to use it.

This Shiny application is part of the Developing Data Products Coursera course project <https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-science-project/>.

The idea is to make a prediction of the next word given a sentence of 3 words at most. This is not a perfect model because it was train just with a subset of the original data. If user has no idea or gives a sentence out of the training dataset, it will recommend some of the sentences that are in the model to give it a try.
